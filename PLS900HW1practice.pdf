## Homework Project 1

We want to print only the elements from values that are not in primes

So, first, we need to create our values and primes objects

``` {r}
primes <- c(2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,
            43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97)
values <- c(3,4,12,19,23,48,50,61,63,78)
```


We create a loop that (1) cycles through the values of "values" and sets the variable noPrime to FALSE; (2) cycles through "primes" and replaces noPrime with TRUE if the value in "primes" is equal to the value in "values"; and finally (3) prints the value in "values" if noPrime is FALSE. This leaves with only the values printed which appear in "values" that are not in "primes."

```{r}
for(v in values){
    noPrime <- F
  for (p in primes) {
    if(v == p){
      noPrime <- T
    }
  }
    if (noPrime == F){
      print(v)
    }
}
```
