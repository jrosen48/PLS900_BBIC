## Homework Project 1

We want to print only the elements from values that are not in primes

So, first, we need to create our values and primes objects

``` {r}
primes <- c(2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,
            43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97)
values <- c(3,4,12,19,23,48,50,61,63,78)
```
